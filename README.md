# THE COOLER DICTIONARY 

### Background
Ever wanted walking past your fridge to stimulate your brain instead of your 
stomach? The Cooler Dictionary* was created with that goal in mind. Suitable for 
both eaters and readers, the Cooler Dictionary allows the user to rearrange 
magnetic letters on the fridge to spell out a word.... What do you think happens 
when you open this kind of fridge? Trust me when I say it's more awesome than 
your typical heavy, dust-ridden dictionary.


### Functionality & MVPs
InÂ the Cooler Dictionary, users will be able to:
- rearrange magnetic letters by dragging them across the surface of the fridge 
to create English words
- pull on the fridge handle to search for that specific query in the Cooler 
Dictionary, returning definitions, synonyms, antonyms, etc.
- see how their queries change the view of the fridge door (eg.  add an image 
of each query as a postcard, have a whiteboard with history of previous queries 
crossed out)
- click a magnet saying "Feeling random?" which will randomly generate a random 
word query and re-arrange the letters

In addition, this project will include:
-  instructions that show per point-and-click object upon hover
-  light functionality when the fridge door is opened or closed
- eraser for Whiteboard that can be used to erase and rearrange letters to a 
previous word
-  potentially showing the definition as a Nutrition Facts label of a bottle of 
Andok's Litson Sauce (Filipino product)
- random quote about food generated as a wall sign
