Drag and drop the magnetic letters to the query area that glows in the middle of the fridge.





# PART 2: THE COOLER DICTIONARY ***
## (Adding Dictionary Functionality)
*** Title Credit: Kyle Ginzburg


### Background

Ever wanted walking past your fridge to stimulate your brain instead of your stomach? The Cooler Dictionary was created with that goal in mind. Suitable for both eaters and readers, the Cooler Dictionary allows the user to rearrange magnetic letters on the fridge to spell out a word.... What do you think happens when you open this kind of fridge? Trust me when I say it's more awesome than your typical heavy, dust-ridden dictionary.

  

### Functionality & MVPs

InÂ the Cooler Dictionary, users will be able to:

- rearrange magnetic letters by dragging them across the surface of the fridge to create English words

- pull on the fridge handle to search for that specific query in the Cooler Dictionary, returning definitions, synonyms, antonyms, etc.

- see how their queries change the view of the fridge door (eg. add an image of each query as a postcard, have a whiteboard with history of previous queries crossed out)

- click a magnet saying "Feeling random?" which will randomly generate a random word query and re-arrange the letters

  

In addition, this project will include:

- instructions that show per point-and-click object upon hover

- light functionality when the fridge door is opened or closed

- eraser for Whiteboard that can be used to erase and rearrange letters to a previous word

- random quote about food generated as a wall sign
